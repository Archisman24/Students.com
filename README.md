# Student Information Website
This is a basic website that displays information about students. It allows you to search for students, add new student records, and edit existing student information.

# Technologies Used
- Flask: a Python web framework
- SQLite: a lightweight database management system
- HTML: for creating the structure and content of web pages
- Bootstrap CSS: for styling the web pages
- Jinja2: a template engine for rendering dynamic content in Flask

# Features
- Search: You can search for students by their names. The website provides a search form where you can enter a student's name and retrieve matching records.
- Add Student: You can add new student records by filling out a form with the student's name, ID, address, gender, date of birth, and scores in specific subjects (Chemistry, Math, and Physics).
- Edit Student: The website allows you to edit existing student information. You can update the student's name, address, gender, date of birth, and scores. The changes are reflected in the database.

# Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication to secure the website and restrict access to certain functionalities.
- Improve the user interface with a more appealing design using CSS or a front-end framework.
- Add validation and error handling to provide better feedback to users in case of incorrect inputs or failed operations.
- Implement pagination or filtering options for the search results to handle a large number of records efficiently.
- Add functionality to delete student records.
